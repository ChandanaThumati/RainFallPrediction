# RainFallPrediction

## Problem Definition 

Climate is an important aspect of human life.In this project we are trying to deal with the prediction of rainfall which is a major aspect of human life and which provides the major resource of human life that is Fresh Water.

Task (T) : To predict the rainfall in india
  
Experience (E) :  Run it through a machine learning algorithm with data about past rainfall patterns.
  
Performance Measure(P) : The percentage of accuracy predicted by the model.
    
 ## Dataset Used in these models
